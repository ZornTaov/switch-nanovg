# nanovg for libnx

This project can be used as a skeleton to create a nanovg app on the Switch using libnx. Just replace the demo by your own code.

nanovg is included as a [subrepo](https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo) in `libs/nanovg`. The library is untouched for now.

The demo has been modified to use the glad loader instead of GLFW and to load assets from romfs. The rest is untouched.
